// so typeScript is superscript of javascript
// it is enhanced version of javascript
// developed by micrpsoft
// angular frame work associated wid google and microsoft
// combo of two biggest company
//  ts was invented by microsft and angular by google hence it is more durable 
// why angular over react :--- angular is a product of g + msft and every 6 mnths it gets updated also while developing complex project go with angular
// Typescript is  TYPESAFE PROGRAMING LANG..
// I.E we cannot assign another type of value to a particular defined data type // eg var x = 10 ; x= "20" ,, here 20 will not be assnngd to x as it is a numver data type
// javascript is dyanamic it will take watever data type we give or update
// WE convert ts to js as browser understnds jscript and for conversion we use tsc compiller
// so angular to ts and ts to js and then coded is executed
// during the compilling phase we check type saftey like for instance 
// let isMarried = true
// isMarried = "20"
// so above before compilling we will chk the data type
// data type assign arne use : 
// the return type of function is void which means it does not return any value
// reminder return k baad ka code nai execute hota hai....
//  to check version of node js type cmd n the node -v
// how to del any programme go to control panel and then uninstall apps and do the changes
