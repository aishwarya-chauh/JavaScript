// Ternary or Logical operator
// ? "String" : "String"  ====== is the syntax to use ternary operator
// Condition are mainly of two types 
// && in this both the conditions should be fulfilled
// ||  in this anyone condition if fulfilled it will log the values....
//  &&   \\  both these are termesd AS logical operators
//  ssc hsc are operands
// operator are special symbols used to perform opertion on operands..
// TYPES OF OPERATORS
// ARITHMATIC  ====== + , - , * ,/ , %, **, ++, -- 
// ASSIGNMENT "      =       " WHICH ASSIGNS VALUE
// COMPARISON ======= "  ==  ", !=, ===(sTRICT EQUAL TOO ), !==(NOT STRICT EQUAL TOO), >= , +<, < , >
// LOGICAL === && , || , !
// IN && IF ANY ONE VSLUE IS TRUE AND OTHER IS FALSE THEN RESULT IS FALSE
// IN || IF ANY ONE VALUE IS TRUE AND THE OTHER FALSE THEN RESULT IS TRUE 
// "===" IS MOSTLY USED AND IT CHECKS THE DATA TYPE AND VALUE AS WELL
// "==" ONLY CHECKS ITS VALUE
